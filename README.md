# VuePen

This is a clone of popular platform [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) with inspiration from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) where this is built with React.  
Idea was to create this in Vue and show differences.

> Note: This is built with bundless Vue approach.
